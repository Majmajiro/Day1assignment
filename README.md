Introduction to software engineering
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
   Software engineering is writing instructions or code for computers, building applications,games and websites that make our lives easier while solving real world problems through       technology. It is important to develop reliable, efficient and scalable software systems.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
  Creation of structured development methods to create reliable, easy to maintain and cost effective software
  Efficient and manageable ways of writing software
  Introduction of flexible, interative approaches to customer needs and continuous improvement

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   Planning - figure out what you need, for what purpose and the cost implications connected to it
   Requirement analysis - research and understand what the software is needed for
   Design - Create frameworks for how the software will work and look to the users
   Coding - Write the code based on design and findings during research
   Testing - Check for errors and anticipate it's functionality to the end user
   Launching - Release the software to the end user to be used in the real world
   Maintenance - fix issues, update features, and keep improving the software over time
   
4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Waterfall Methodologies have a step by step approach when one phse must be completed before moving on to the next, are not flexible, takes more time and testing is done at the end 
   of the project. This is best for projects with clear and fixed requirements like building a bridge or highway, or developing a banking software

   Agile Methodologies are flexible and work is done in small cycles. Changes can be done at anytime and delivery is seen sooner; or faster since its in small batches. Additionally, 
   testing is done throughout the project. Examples of these would be games and apps.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Software developer - writes the code that makes the software work. He/she creates and develops software based on requirements, fixes errors and  improves features, works with the       team to make sure the software works as intended.
  Quality Assurance Engineer - tests the software to make sure it works correctly and is free of bugs, finds and reports issues with the software, makes sure it meets quality standards   and creates test cases to check how it performs.
  Project Manager - Oversees the project, keeps the team organised and ensures deadlines ate met. They do this by managing and planning timelines, communicating with the team and     
  keeping the project on track.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  An integrated development environment (IDE) -  provides features like code suggestions, debugging tools, and project organisations in one place. They also make coding faster and        easier by automating repetitive tasks; and helps reduce errors with built-in tools for checking mistakes. Examples are Visual Studio Code (VS Code), pyCharm and IntelliJ IDEA

  Version Control Systems (VCS) - saves different versions of code, so you can go back and retrieve it if something breaks; allows teams to collaborate without conflicts and helps keep   a history of changes for better tracking and troubleshooting. Examples are GIT (used with GitHub or GitLab), and Apache Subversion(SVN)

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   Errors and bugs - Errors that cause softwares to crash or not work properly
   Solution: Test the code regularly, use debugginh tools available and follow best coding practices

   Tight deadlines - Strict deadlines making it stressful to complete tasks on time
   Solution: Find and utilise time management tools like Trello and decompose the task to smaller and manageable parts

   Keeping up with new and emerging technology - Technology tools, frameworks and languages change so fast
   Solution: Keep learning always, take online courses and practice with the newtechnologies

   Working in  a team - Miscommunication may led to misunderstanding in teams
   Solution: Use tools like Git for teanwork, meet regularly and document code properly.

   Security threats - Hackers !
   Solution: Follow security best practices ike encrypting data, validating user inputs, and updating software regularly

   Code Complexity and Maintenance - As software grows, the code becomes harder to manage and update
   Solution: Write clean code and well-structured code, use comments, and follow coding standards

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   Unit testing - tests small parts of code, like functions or methods, to check if they work properly. It catches errors early and makes it easier to fix issues before they grow
   Integration testing - checks if different parts of the software work well together. It ensures that combined features dont cause unexpected issues
   System testing - tests the entire application as a whole to ensure it meets requirements. This confirms that all features work together as expected before release
   Acceptance testing - checks if the software meets user expectations and business needs. This ensures the software is ready for customers before launch
   
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

9. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Prompt engineering  - designing and refining instructions given to an AI model to get the best possble responses. 
  Importance:
  Better AI responses - well crafted prompts help AI give more accurate and relevant answers
  Efficiency - saves time by reducing the need for multiple retries to get a good response
  Customization - helps AI create responses tailored to the specific needs of the one prompting
  Problem-solving - allows users to guide AI to generate useful solutions, code, or research insights
  Improved user experience - makes interaction with AI smoother, more intuitive, and more productive

10. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
" Tell me about technology "

  "Explain how Artificial Intelligence is used in healthcare to improve patient diagnosis and treatment"

  More Specific - focuses on AI in healthcare rather than broad technology
  Clear Purpose - asks for an explanation rather than a general discussion 
  Concise - keeps the request direct and easy to understand
  Better AI response - guides the AI to provide useful and relevant information
